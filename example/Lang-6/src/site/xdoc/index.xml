<section name="Commons Lang">

<p>
The standard Java libraries fail to provide enough methods for
manipulation of its core classes. Apache Commons Lang provides
these extra methods. 
</p>

<p>
Lang provides a host of helper utilities for the java.lang API, notably 
String manipulation methods, basic numerical methods, object reflection, concurrency, creation and serialization 
and System properties. Additionally it contains basic enhancements to java.util.Date and a series of utilities dedicated to help with 
building methods, such as hashCode, toString and equals.
</p>
<p>
Note that Lang 3.0 (and subsequent versions) use a different package (<i>org.apache.commons.lang3</i>) than the previous versions (<i>org.apache.commons.lang</i>), allowing it to be used at the same time as an earlier version.
