This document contains the release notes for the 3.1 version of Apache Commons Lang.
Commons Lang is a set of utility functions and reusable components that should be of use in any 
Java environment.

Lang 3.0 and onwards now targets Java 5.0, making use of features that arrived with Java 5.0 such as generics, 
variable arguments, autoboxing, concurrency and formatted output.

For the advice on upgrading from 2.x to 3.x, see the following page:
